The ski trip planning recommendation service will take the form of a web-based application developed in Python, a language well-suited for both data manipulation and web applications. The Pandas library will be employed for efficient data manipulation and analysis, while Flask will serve as the framework to create the web interface.
Upon accessing the main dashboard, users will encounter a preferences selection box where they can specify their preferences for the mountain experience they seek. A click on the search button will trigger the generation of a list of top resorts based on these preferences, presenting users with comprehensive details about each resort.
Key functionalities include the ability for users to select and save preferred resorts to their account for future reference. Upon logging in, users will be greeted with a personalized homepage featuring related recommendations based on their saved resorts. This streamlined process ensures that users have a user-friendly and efficient experience, from initial preferences to personalized recommendations.
